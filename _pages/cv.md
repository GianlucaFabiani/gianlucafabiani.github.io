Biography
======
Gianluca Fabiani holds a Bachelor’s in Mathematics and a Master’s in Applied Mathematics from the University of Naples Federico II, and a PhD in Modeling and Engineering Risk and Complexity from the School of Advanced Studies of Naples (Scuola Superiore Meridionale, SSM). He was also a Visiting Student in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. Fabiani specializes in data-driven scientific machine learning for modeling complex systems, bridging numerical analysis and machine learning to create interpretable, resource-efficient methods. His research addresses forward and inverse problems in neuroscience, epidemiology, and finance, with 14 publications, including a feature in Nature Communications, an Editor's Pick in Chaos,
