Biography
======
Dr. Gianluca Fabiani is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Hopkins Extreme Materials Institute (HEMI), Johns Hopkins University, working with Prof. Yannis G. Kevrekidis. He completed his Ph.D. in Modeling and Engineering Risk and Complexity (MERC) at the Scuola Superiore Meridionale (Naples), under the supervision of Prof. Constantinos Siettos and co-advising of Prof. Kevrekidis. He holds an M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics with honors from the University of Naples Federico II.

His research focuses on solving forward and inverse problems for ODEs, PDEs, and agent-based models using machine learning and numerical analysis. He develops multi-scale, data-driven frameworks based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and random projection neural networks (RPNNs) for tasks such as bifurcation analysis, control design, and rare event estimation. His work bridges data-driven and mechanistic modeling with applications spanning climate, epidemiology, and complex materials.

Dr. Fabiani has authored 17 research papers, including in Nature Communications, Journal of Computational Physics, and SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, and has collaborated with over 30 researchers across disciplines.
